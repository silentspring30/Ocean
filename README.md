   - [ ] Engage with 5 groups. I only engaged with some AI individuals. However their feedback was very skeptical, there seems to be a lot of caution from the AI community towards web3. This needs to be researched further. By reading the tweets and blogs, there seems to be a lot of mistrusts towards web3, silicon valley and long term altruism.
   - [ ] Share tutorials and blogs with communities and/or host 20min online sessions with groups.
   - Not yet, due to the reasons above I was slightly hesitant how to approach them.  
   - [ ] I have not shared the blogs with communities yet or have been able to host 20min session with them.
    - Not yet, due to the reasons above I was slightly hesitant how to approach them.
   - [X] Conduct qualitative user research on “barriers to selling data and algorithms” and “community approach on selling data”.

   - AI experts were open to the idea of data selling but didn't trust blockchain/web3. 
   - [ ] Engage with communities on twitter, discord and telegram. F
   - For the above reasons I was slightly hesitant.

Value Add Criteria
