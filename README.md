  * UPDATE on time spent: 
   * In preparation to reaching out to AI communities, I had to be prepared for questions and since I'm new to OCEAN and decentralized AI safety spent time researching and reading articles on AI safety, Ethics and decentralization. I also realized that I had to frame the outreach differently, since it could come potentially could come across as a web3scam (When I started to reach out, I got some mixed feedback from respondents).
* Based on these insights, I reframed as: **Could-communities-reduce-bias-in-AI-by-selling-data-on-Ocean-and-getting-remunerated-for-it?** rather then "How to sell data in Ocean".
  * Researched decentralized AI and Safety, and focused on how to mitigate Bias. Biggest questions here to explore AI development, Data collection, How to mitigate data bias. I developed my main argument here that Ocean marketplace could allow the decentralization of data.
  * Researched how to potentially onboard AI communities to data trusts, e.g. Datatrusts and how the onboarding would work. Biggest questions where in how to agree on a data privacy framework.
  * Researched how and where the data would be residing e.g. AWS or IFPS? How is security ensured?
  * Review current dialogue of minority AI groups: e.g. DAIR, AI groups re Web3 and biggest topics. E.g. Data bias and concerns of exploitation data labellers.
 
 * Tutorials: I researched what kind of Ocean tutorials are currently available and decided on a shorter and less technical format. 
  Researched Ocean Market, Researched Ocean Compute-to-Data. I also had to set up my Metamask for testing: How to get set up on Goerli and get test tokens Ether and OCEAN.

   - [X] Shortlist 10 groups and engage e.g. Women in AI, Black in AI, DAIR and youth groups in AI.

   - [ ] Engage with 5 groups. I only engaged with some AI individuals. However their feedback was very skeptical, there seems to be a lot of caution from the AI community towards web3. This needs to be researched further. By reading the tweets and blogs, there seems to be a lot of mistrusts towards web3 and Silicon valley. 
   * Next steps, start engaging with 5 groups and gather feedback.
   
   - [ ] Share tutorials and blogs with communities and/or host 20min online sessions with groups.
   * Not yet, due to the reasons above I was slightly hesitant how to approach them.  
   * Next steps, start engaging with 5 groups and gather feedback.
   
   - [ ] I have not shared the blogs with communities yet or have been able to host 20min session with them.
    - Not yet, due to the reasons above I was slightly hesitant how to approach them.
    
   - [X] Conduct qualitative user research on “barriers to selling data and algorithms” and “community approach on selling data”.
   - I conducted 3 user interviews 1:1, with general people and AI experts. Everyday people seemed not to concerned about their data, they used: Google Home, Shazaam, Amazon and Google documents and it didn't occur to them yet that they could sell their data and get remunerated for it.
   - AI experts were open to the idea of data selling but didn't trust blockchain/web3. 
   
   - [ ] Engage with communities on twitter, discord and telegram.
   - For the above reasons I was slightly hesitant.

Value Add Criteria

We believe that AI can solve humanity's biggest obstacles, however communities need to be aware of how to collect, share meaningful data to train AI models. This new outreach proposal will drive forward awareness for co-designing data collection and how to leverage Ocean market.


a. Usage of Ocean

This project will drive awareness about data monetization strategies of Ocean market to diverse AI communities beyond web3.


    Outreach
    Content creation for education
    Simple Guides
    Community discussions


b. Viability — what is the chance of success of the project?

Silentspring30 is a design-led AI product manager with over 10 years of experience in product development, community engagement and is currently a fastai student. Silentspring30 leads stories_for_ai, a squad of Algovera and has received one grant for development work of a Decentralized AI DAO framework. 


She previously led tido London a product development group based on technology standard called Solid [socially linked data]. Solid allows the storage of data in personal data pods [https://solidproject.org].


c. Community active-ness — how active is the team in the community?

Stories_of_ai is actively looking for a purpose to be active in the Ocean community and to contribute with research and community engagement beyond web3.

    d. Adding value to the community — how well does the outcome of the project add value to the overall Ocean community / ecosystem? 


We believe that increased awareness, research and tutorial content will create added value to the Ocean community.
